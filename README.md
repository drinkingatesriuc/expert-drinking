# A GeoDrinker's guide to the ESRI-UC

## Purpose
The ESRI-UC is the largest geospatial technology conference. Attracting nearly 15,000 people each year, it is one of the top five conferences in San Diego, in one of the premier conference centers in the United States. 

This guide is about enjoying alcohol while attending the the ESRI User Conference.  ESRI-UC or just the “UC” to those in the know. Whether you want to sip finely aged bourbons, chug light lagers, indulge in California fines wines, or all of the above, this guide is for you.

Getting something out of the UC would be helpful too. Otherwise you may not get to go again next year.

Writing a guide is hard. It's harder when your either coding or drinking. So let's crowdsource this! 

If the guide is completed, an attempt to publish it as an ebook may be made. The profits will be donated to GISCorps, unless the profits are so huge that I could quit my daytime GIS-job and live off the ebook profits.  

@drunkarcpy will have the final say in all things.


## Code of Conduct

This guide is about drinking. This guide is meant to be humorous, even mildly offensive (like fart-joke offensive). This guide will not be a means to harass anyone.

The guide be gender and sexual orientation neutral, meaning the reader could be either Male, Female, Straight, or LGBT. However the guide could cover gender/sexual-orientation specific safety issues (such as being drunk in a room full the opposite gender).  Always, the guide is meant to be  harassment-free for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or geospatial software choices. 

If you find a section that you feel violates the code of conduct, post an issue. Ideally identify the section that is offensive, why it is offensive and potential revisions to make it not offensive. If you do not wish to make it public, please DM @drunkarcpy on twitter.
